0.2.42
--------
* Ti.UI.OptionDialog markup parser added. Check out this link for a test app and usage: [https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/test/apps/ui/optiondialog](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/test/apps/ui/optiondialog)
* You can get the Alloy version at runtime now with `Alloy.version`
* Tightened up XML ID restrictions. As an enforced best practice, no reserved JS words as IDs. If you try to, you'll get a compile time error message.
* Revamp of code processing, better organized, more efficient. It's all under the hood, you shouldn't notice, other than compiles might be faster.
* Quick fix to error output in compiler plugin.py
* Some minor cleanup in the test apps
